            <h2>Backup</h2>
            <p>Being a step ahead and preparing for liable disruptions is important. A business can be successful only if it anticipates the future disasters and has a robust and perfect backup strategy to encounter any unexpected inconvenience. The cloud-based backup strategy is cost efficient, secure, and simple. Venturing and implementing a backup proposal incorporates many challenging tasks, as data continues to grow rapidly and compliance requirements emerge, backing up your data becomes more perplexing every day. Is long-term retention affecting your backup infrastructure to fall out of control? Are you concerned about the recoverability of old tapes?

        </div>
<div class="row">
    <h2>Disaster Recovery</h2>
    <p>If there is a plan for success, there must also be a plan for the risk involved in the success path. Nothing short of a so-called term disaster. As customer expectations reach the pinnacle, enterprises are struggling hard to scope that expected goal and give the best service to its clients from all quarters. What if there is a breakdown of business continuity and disaster recovery? Disaster recovery management has become the walk and talk in every business. No matter small or medium or large scale business, managing disaster recovery and understanding the risks involved in it is crucial. Data is unlimited, mounting rapidly along with business requirements. Where there is data, there is something hidden in the data called the critical information, and when there is sensitive information, there must be a strategy to secure the information from the effects of any adverse events or security breaches. Traditional and legacy tactics to protect your dynamic data is not going to be the best options anymore. A reliable disaster recovery strategy overcomes and covers the risks such as risk of life to employees, disruption to Business Process, Management Control & Asset recovery. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) plays a significant role that determines an organization’s disaster recovery requirements. Synectiks DRaaS for enterprises enables to rapidly restore applications and data by failing over to Scloud according to your RTO and RPO.</p>
